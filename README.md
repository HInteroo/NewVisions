# NewVisions

Javascript Engineering Resident Performance Task - New Visions for Public Schools

Steps Taken:
First - Webserver. I used a web server called XAMPP:https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html. 

Note: Reasons for using XAMPP was mainly because i was already familiar with this web server which allowed me to use the students.json file on my Google Chrome and create a index.html file that allowed me to insert my data from findLowestAverages() & groupByGrade(). I was also familiar with working/using localhost/NewVisions/index.html on my Google Chrome browser.
   
Second - In order to use XAMPP, one must put the file "NewVisions" inside /htdocs/ folder inside XAMPP so that you can use the server alongside the program.

Note: In my case, i had to put NewVisions folder inside C:\xampp\htdocs\ which allowed me to get onto my localserver: http://localhost/NewVisions/index.html.

URL for the program: https://hinteroo.github.io/NewVisions/index.html

I have written down some notes in my files.
