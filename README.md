Javascript Engineering Resident Performance Task - New Visions for Public Schools

Steps Taken:
   I installed a web server called XAMPP https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html. Reasons for using XAMPP was mainly because i was already familiar with this web server which allowed me to use the students.json file on my Google Chrome and create a index.html file that allowed me to insert my data from findLowestAverages() & groupByGrade(). I was also familiar with working/using localhost/NewVisions/index.html on my Google Chrome browser.
   
I have written down some notes in my files.
